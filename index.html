        <h3>I'm a product designer living in Orlando, Florida. I'm currently Head of Design at <a href="https://streamyard.com">StreamYard</a>, a product that makes it easy for anyone to become a successful live streamer, all from the browser. Before that, I worked at <a href="https://automattic.com">Automattic</a> shaping experiences for WordPress, a platform that powers more than 35% of the web.</h3>
        <p>I’m a human-centered, process-oriented, and results-focused designer. I begin every design project asking three fundamental questions: Who is the user? What problem(s) of theirs are we trying to solve? And what does the current data say? I find that deeply understanding the answers to those questions provides the necessary framing for the work that follows.</p>
        <p>Good design is intentional, focuses on the end user, and ultimately motivates people to take action. Good product design is a combination of devotion and empathy for customer needs (researching and connecting with the problems to be solved), good visual strategy (translating ideas well to actually solve those problems), and leadership (making signals from noisy inputs, building alignment and driving meaningful progress forward).</p>
        <p>I’m an avid thinker and doer. That inspires my ever-growing list of product, research, and writing projects. I value impact, effective execution and communication, introspection and personal growth, and engaging in behaviors that are good for me, good for others, and good for the world.</p>

          <div class="wrap-inner">
            <div>
              <h4>Lean strategy</h4>
              <p>The ultimate goal is value for the user. I use hypothesis based problem solving to validate and measure the efficacy of ideas, as early and as often as possible. I work with teams to frame the purpose and goals of the work, prototype the concepts, test those prototypes with real users, and deliver them as solutions that are measured and brought back into a continuous cycle of improvement.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
              <h4>User research</h4>
              <p>To be truly human-centered means integrating with the people you’re solving problems for. Not just through observation and communication, but also through real, empathetic connection, becoming immersed in what users are doing, thinking, and feeling. I always begin my research process with an understanding of the persona(s) I'm connecting with and the problem(s) they’re facing, along with any quantitative and qualitative insights that might influence that understanding. I then outline a research plan, conduct sessions, and synthesize the learnings.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
              <h4>Problem framing and discovery</h4>
              <p>A solution without a problem isn’t a solution. To understand the user and the business problems we’re looking to solve, they need to be defined so that we have a guided path forward:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Who are the users (or business parts) were focused on?</li>
                <li>What problem of theirs are we going after?</li>
                <li>How do we intend to solve it?</li>
                <li>Who’s involved and what roles do they play?</li>
                <li>How much time are we devoting to building the solution?</li>
                <li>What's in scope? Also, what are we NOT going to do?</li>
                <li>What are the risks and dependencies? Are there any particular considerations that need to be addressed?</li>
              </ul>
            </div>
            <div>
              <h4>Information architecture</h4>
              <p>Understanding what is most important to your target visitor/user is essential before any in-depth design work happens. What needs to be communicated and in what priority? How do we get them from point A to D in the most effective manner so they can achieve their goals?</p>
            </div>
            <div>
              <h4>Sketching</h4>
              <p>Early in the design process, I'll often marker-sketch ideas to provide just enough detail to have a productive discussion. I’m mostly concerned with ensuring we’ve considered the appropriate cases and that were aligned on the overall experience, before we get caught up in visual details.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
              <h4>Prototyping</h4>
              <p>I strive for high fidelity early on. Using and feeling something is much different than just looking at it and talking about it. The more real that experience is, where you can interact with it like the end-product, the better the conversations and insights, especially when you can get it in the hands of actual users.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
              <h4>Usability testing</h4>
              <p>User testing is one of the most exciting aspects of my role, as it's the first real glimpse into whether your assumptions and approach to the solution are promising and viable.</p>
