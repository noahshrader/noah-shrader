      <h3>I'm a product designer living in Orlando, Florida. I'm currently Head of Design at <a href="https://streamyard.com">StreamYard</a>, a product that makes it easy for anyone to become a successful live streamer, all from the browser. Before that, I worked at <a href="https://automattic.com">Automattic</a> shaping experiences for WordPress, a platform that powers more than 35% of the web.</h3>
      <p>I’m a human-centered, process-oriented, and results-focused designer. I begin every design project asking three fundamental questions: Who is the user? What problem(s) of theirs are we trying to solve? And what does the current data say? I find that deeply understanding the answers to those questions provides the necessary framing for the work that follows.</p>
      <p>Good design is intentional, focuses on the end user, and ultimately motivates people to take action. Good product design is a combination of devotion and empathy for customer needs (researching and connecting with the problems to be solved), good visual strategy (translating ideas well to actually solve those problems), and leadership (making signals from noisy inputs, building alignment and driving meaningful progress forward).</p>
      <p>I’m an avid thinker and doer. That inspires my ever-growing list of product, research, and writing projects. I value impact, effective execution and communication, introspection and personal growth, and engaging in behaviors that are good for me, good for others, and good for the world.</p>
